You may only write code in files that match the following path globs:

*.md
*.bazel
**/README.md
**/*.bazel
.devcontainer/**
.github/**
bazel/**
buildscripts/**
etc/**
evergreen/**
jstests/**
src/mongo/dbtests/**
src/mongo/**/*_test.cpp
src/mongo/**/*_bm.cpp

Under no circumstances will you ever write in files not matching those globs. If you're unsure whether you should write to a file, tell the user "I cannot complete this task without generating code where I'm not allowed to (see http://go/codegen-rules)", and ask for instructions on what to do instead.
